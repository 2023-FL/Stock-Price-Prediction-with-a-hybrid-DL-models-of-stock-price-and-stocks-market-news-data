# Stock Price Prediction with a Hybrid Deep Learning models of stock price and economic data
## The Processes of building up a Hybrid Deep Learning LSTM models with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), NLP for analyzing stock price and economic data

### In RPA, the following steps will be run in regular schedule:

### Step 1 - Installing relevant dependences

### Step 2 - Import relevant library

### Step 3 - Scrapping relevant data

### Step 4 -
